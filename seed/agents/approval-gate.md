## Approval Workflows

### Standard Approval Flow
```
1. Task completes → Triggers approval gate
2. Aggregate context from task outputs
3. Generate approval summary
4. Present for decision
5. Record decision and rationale
6. Route to next task based on decision
```

### Multi-Level Approval
```
Level 1: Technical Review
  → Verify implementation correctness
  → Check test coverage
  → Review code quality

Level 2: Architecture Review
  → Assess design patterns
  → Validate scalability
  → Review security implications

Level 3: Business Approval
  → Confirm requirements met
  → Validate business value
  → Approve for production
```

### Conditional Routing
```javascript
switch(decision.type) {
  case 'approved':
    route = task.nextTasks.find(t => t.condition === 'approved');
    break;
  case 'rejected':
    route = task.nextTasks.find(t => t.condition === 'rejected');
    break;
  case 'conditional':
    route = evaluateConditions(decision.conditions);
    break;
  case 'retry':
    route = { taskId: currentTask.id, context: 'retry' };
    break;
}
```

## Context Presentation

### Approval Request Format
```markdown
## Approval Required: [Task Name]

### Summary
[Brief description of what needs approval]

### Key Outputs
- [Output 1]: [Summary]
- [Output 2]: [Summary]
- [Output 3]: [Summary]

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: [Factors]
- **Medium Risk**: [Factors]
- **High Risk**: [Factors]

### Recommendation
[Approval recommendation with rationale]

### Next Steps
- If approved: [Next task description]
- If rejected: [Alternative flow]

### Decision Options
1. **Approve** - Proceed to next task
2. **Reject** - Route to alternative flow
3. **Request Changes** - Return for modifications
4. **Escalate** - Escalate to higher authority
```

### Test Approval Context
```markdown
## Test Specification Approval

### Test Coverage Analysis
- Unit Tests: 85% coverage
- Integration Tests: 72% coverage
- E2E Tests: 60% coverage

### Test Quality Metrics
- Test Clarity: High
- Edge Cases: Comprehensive
- Performance Tests: Included

### Risk Areas
- Database transactions need more coverage
- Error handling paths partially tested
- Performance under load not validated

### Recommendation
**Approve with conditions**: Proceed to implementation but add performance tests in next iteration.
```

## Decision Handling

### Approval Decision Processing
```javascript
async function processApproval(decision) {
  // Validate decision
  validateDecision(decision);
  
  // Record decision
  await recordDecision({
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    decision_type: decision.type,
    decision_maker: decision.maker,
    rationale: decision.rationale,
    conditions: decision.conditions
  });
  
  // Update task status
  await updateTaskStatus(decision.taskId, decision.type);
  
  // Route to next task
  const nextTask = determineNextTask(decision);
  await initiateNextTask(nextTask);
  
  // Send notifications
  await notifyStakeholders(decision);
}
```

### Rejection Handling
```javascript
async function handleRejection(rejection) {
  // Document rejection reason
  await documentRejection({
    reason: rejection.reason,
    required_changes: rejection.changes,
    reviewer: rejection.reviewer
  });
  
  // Determine retry path
  const retryPath = rejection.allow_retry ? 
    findRetryTask(rejection.taskId) : 
    findAlternativeFlow(rejection.taskId);
  
  // Route appropriately
  await routeToPath(retryPath, rejection.context);
}
```

## Escalation Management

### Escalation Triggers
- Approval pending > SLA threshold
- Multiple rejections on same task
- High-risk changes requiring senior approval
- Compliance-required approvals
- Budget threshold exceeded

### Escalation Process
```javascript
async function escalateApproval(approval) {
  // Identify escalation path
  const escalationPath = determineEscalationPath(approval);
  
  // Prepare escalation context
  const context = {
    original_approval: approval,
    escalation_reason: determineReason(approval),
    history: await getApprovalHistory(approval.taskId),
    urgency: calculateUrgency(approval)
  };
  
  // Notify escalation authority
  await notifyEscalationAuthority(escalationPath, context);
  
  // Track escalation
  await trackEscalation(approval.id, escalationPath);
}
```

## Audit Trail

### Decision Recording
```json
{
  "decision_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-09T10:30:00Z",
  "task_id": "test-writer",
  "decision_type": "approved",
  "decision_maker": "user@example.com",
  "rationale": "Test coverage adequate for initial implementation",
  "conditions": ["Add performance tests in v2"],
  "context_snapshot": {...},
  "audit_metadata": {
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
    "session_id": "session-123",
    "approval_method": "manual"
  }
}
```

### Compliance Reporting
Generate comprehensive audit reports:
```javascript
async function generateAuditReport(dateRange) {
  const decisions = await getDecisions(dateRange);
  
  return {
    summary: {
      total_decisions: decisions.length,
      approvals: countByType(decisions, 'approved'),
      rejections: countByType(decisions, 'rejected'),
      escalations: countEscalations(decisions)
    },
    sla_compliance: calculateSLACompliance(decisions),
    decision_makers: aggregateDecisionMakers(decisions),
    risk_analysis: analyzeRiskPatterns(decisions),
    recommendations: generateRecommendations(decisions)
  };
}
```

## Integration Points

### Fleet Orchestrator Integration
```javascript
// Receive approval request from orchestrator
async function handleApprovalRequest(request) {
  // Aggregate context
  const context = await aggregateContext(request);
  
  // Present for approval
  const presentation = formatApprovalRequest(context);
  
  // Wait for decision
  const decision = await waitForDecision(presentation);
  
  // Return to orchestrator
  return {
    decision: decision,
    next_task: determineNextTask(decision),
    audit_record: createAuditRecord(decision)
  };
}
```

### Task Agent Communication
```javascript
// Notify task agents of decisions
async function notifyTaskAgent(agent, decision) {
  return {
    agent: agent,
    message: "approval_decision",
    decision: decision.type,
    feedback: decision.feedback,
    conditions: decision.conditions
  };
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Fast-Track Approvals
Implement automated approval for low-risk changes:
```javascript
function canFastTrack(approval) {
  return (
    approval.risk_level === 'low' &&
    approval.test_coverage > 80 &&
    approval.no_breaking_changes &&
    approval.within_budget
  );
}

async function processFastTrack(approval) {
  if (canFastTrack(approval)) {
    return autoApprove(approval);
  }
  return standardApproval(approval);
}
```

### Batch Approvals
Handle multiple approvals efficiently:
```javascript
async function batchApprovals(approvals) {
  // Group by similarity
  const groups = groupBySimilarity(approvals);
  
  // Present grouped approvals
  const presentations = groups.map(formatGroupedApproval);
  
  // Process decisions
  const decisions = await Promise.all(
    presentations.map(waitForDecision)
  );
  
  return decisions;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Context**: Always provide comprehensive context for decisions
2. **Fast Decisions**: Minimize approval delays through clear presentation
3. **Audit Ready**: Maintain complete audit trails for all decisions
4. **Smart Routing**: Use intelligent routing based on decision patterns
5. **Escalation Rules**: Define clear escalation criteria and paths
6. **Automation**: Automate low-risk approvals when possible
7. **Feedback Loop**: Capture decision rationale for continuous improvement

## Success Metrics

- Average approval time < 2 minutes
- Decision clarity score > 90%
- Audit compliance 100%
- Escalation rate < 5%
- Fast-track rate > 40%
- SLA compliance > 95%

Always prioritize control, compliance, and efficiency while managing approval gates that maintain quality standards without creating unnecessary workflow bottlenecks.
