# Carrier 🚀

**Fleet Orchestration System for Claude Code**

Carrier is a powerful orchestration system that enables you to deploy and manage complex multi-agent workflows (called "fleets") within Claude Code. It provides a CLI interface for deploying, monitoring, and managing sophisticated agent sequences that can handle complex software engineering tasks.

```

## 📖 Core Concepts

### Fleets
**Fleets** are sequences of interconnected tasks executed by specialized agents. Each fleet defines:
- **Tasks**: Individual work units with specific objectives
- **Agents**: Specialized AI agents that execute tasks
- **Routing**: Conditional logic for task progression
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Data flow between tasks

### Tasks
**Tasks** are atomic work units within a fleet:
- Executed by specific agent types (e.g., `code-analyzer`, `research-analyst`)
- Can have approval gates for human oversight
- Support conditional routing based on results
- Generate outputs consumed by subsequent tasks

### Deployments
**Deployments** are active instances of fleets:
- Track execution state and progress
- Maintain task history and outputs
- Support pause/resume functionality
- Enable monitoring and debugging

## 🛠 CLI Commands

### Core Operations
```bash
# Deploy a fleet
carrier deploy <fleet-id> "<request>" [--background]

# Check deployment status
carrier status [deployment-id]

# Approve pending tasks
carrier approve [deployment-id]

# Continue execution from current task
carrier execute <deployment-id>

# Clean up completed deployments
carrier clean [deployment-id] [--keep-outputs] [--force]
```

### Fleet Management
```bash
# List available fleets
carrier ls [--remote] [--testing]

# Get fleet configuration
carrier fleet <fleet-id> [--json]

# Pull fleet from API
carrier pull <fleet-id>

# Push local fleet to API
carrier push <fleet-id>

# Remove fleet
carrier rm <fleet-id> [--remote]
```

### System Commands
```bash
# Authenticate with API
carrier auth

# Show current user
carrier whoami

# Show configuration
carrier config

# Get help
carrier help [command]
```

## 📋 Built-in Fleet Types

Carrier comes with several pre-built fleet types:

### `code` - Code Implementation Fleet
Comprehensive code implementation with analysis, planning, execution, and verification.

```bash
carrier deploy code "Implement user authentication with JWT"
```

**Tasks:**
- `code-analyzer`: Analyzes codebase and requirements
- `code-executor`: Implements the requested changes
- `quality-verifier`: Runs tests and validates implementation

### `research` - Research Fleet
In-depth research and analysis of topics, codebases, or technologies.

```bash
carrier deploy research "Research React performance optimization techniques"
```

**Tasks:**
- `research-analyst`: Conducts comprehensive research
- `search-specialist`: Performs targeted information gathering

### `plan` - Planning Fleet
Strategic planning and requirement analysis before implementation.

```bash
carrier deploy plan "Plan microservices architecture for user management"
```

**Tasks:**
- `requirement-analyzer`: Analyzes requirements and constraints
- `code-analyzer`: Reviews existing codebase architecture

## 🔧 Configuration

Carrier stores configuration in `.carrier/config.json`:

```json
{
  "apiUrl": "https://carrier.sh/api",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "initialized": true,
  "claudeCodeEnabled": true
}
```

### Directory Structure
```
.carrier/
├── config.json          # Main configuration
├── deployed/             # Active deployments
│   ├── registry.json     # Deployment registry
│   └── {id}/            # Individual deployments
│       ├── metadata.json # Deployment metadata
│       ├── request.md    # Original request

    └── {fleet-id}/
        ├── {fleet-id}.json  # Fleet configuration
        └── agents/          # Fleet-specific agents
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Status

### Check Deployment Status
```bash
# List all deployments
carrier status

# Check specific deployment
carrier status 42

# Watch logs in real-time
carrier watch-logs 42 [task-id]
```

### Status Output Example
```
Deployment: 42 (code-001-20241201)
Fleet: code-change
Status: active
Current Task: code-executor

┌─────────────────┬─────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Task            │ Status  │ Agent              │
├─────────────────┼─────────┼────────────────────┤
│ code-analyzer   │ ✅ Done │ code-analyzer      │
│ code-executor   │ ⏳ Active│ code-executor      │
│ quality-verifier│ ⭕ Pending│ quality-verifier   │
└─────────────────┴─────────┴────────────────────┘

Request: Add dark mode toggle to settings
Started: 2024-12-01 10:30:15
```

## 🔄 Task Flow and Approval Gates

Some tasks require human approval before proceeding:

```bash
# Check for approval-required tasks
carrier status 42

# Approve current task
carrier approve 42

# Task continues to next step automatically
```

### Conditional Task Routing
Tasks can route conditionally based on results:

```json
{
  "nextTasks": [
    {
      "taskId": "fix-issues",
      "condition": "failed"
    },
    {
      "taskId": "deploy",
      "condition": "success"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧩 Creating Custom Fleets

### Fleet Configuration
Create a fleet configuration file at `.carrier/fleets/my-fleet/my-fleet.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "my-fleet",
  "name": "My Custom Fleet",

        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "implement",
      "description": "Implement solution",
      "agent": "code-executor",
      "requiresApproval": true,
